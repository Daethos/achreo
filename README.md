<summary>Gameplay</summary>

### Running about the world, you are guaranteed to encounter enemies hostile to your existence, but you come capable of defending yourself! 

### Multiple avenues of dispatching your enemies are present in the form of physical actions, such as swinging your weapon, rolling into them, and dodging or parrying their attacks. You also possess special abilities which are augmented by your mastery: from casting damaging effects and forms of crowd control such as confuse and polymorph, to healing yourself and creating protective shields.

### You may run across enemies fighting each other, and engage with them, or be roped into their melee cause of their general aggression. It is a very unsafe world, proceed with caution!
